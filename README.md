# Project Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of the development, implementation, and applications of a robotic manipulator. The project focuses on the Epson robot, documenting the entire process from the initial stages of programming to the execution of specific tasks.

## Key Highlights

- **Movement Planning & Control**: The project covers the meticulous planning required to design precise movement paths for the manipulator. 
- **Task Automation**: Detailed implementation of commands that allow the robot to execute automated tasks with high accuracy.
- **Efficiency & Precision**: By addressing challenges in both accuracy and efficiency, the project demonstrates the robot’s capability to perform complex operations seamlessly.

Through this work, we aim to showcase the potential of robotic manipulators in automating real-world tasks with reliability and precision, opening the door for more advanced applications in robotics.
