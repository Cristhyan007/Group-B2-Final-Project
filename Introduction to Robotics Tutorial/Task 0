# Task 0: Epson RC Simulation

## Overview

**Task 0** involves simulating the robotic operations of Task 1 (Pick-and-Place) and Task 2 (Stack-Up) using the Epson RC simulator. 
This step allows us to test and refine the logic, movements, and task sequences in a controlled virtual environment before real-world implementation.

## Simulated Tasks

- **Pick-and-Place:** Simulates moving three tokens and three blocks from the Feeder to the Fixture and Tray in an optimized sequence.

## Purpose

- Validate and optimize programming logic.
- Analyze performance metrics such as precision and timing.
- Prepare for seamless execution on the physical Epson robot.

The simulation serves as a foundation for ensuring success in real-world applications of Task 1 and Task 2.
