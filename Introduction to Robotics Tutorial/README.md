# Exploring the Epson Robotic Arm

## Final Project - Robotics Group B2

Welcome to our technological journey! This project serves as the culmination of a semester filled with hands-on learning and creative challenges, as we dove into the world of robotics with the Epson robotic arm. Our main goal is to design and implement efficient solutions to accomplish specific tasks assigned by our professorâ€”all while embracing a competitive spirit!

## Meet the Team ðŸ™Œ

We are **Cristhyan Ojeda**, **Mariano Ovelar**, and **Juan FariÃ±a**â€”a team driven by our passion for robotics and engineering. This project is not just a final exam; itâ€™s a chance to apply the skills weâ€™ve developed throughout the course, including programming, task planning, and operational precision.

## Our Challenges ðŸš€
The project focuses on **3 exciting tasks**:

### 1. **Organized Movement (Pick-and-Place)**

The robot must transport three tokens and three blocks in a planned sequence from the Feeder to the Fixture and then to the Tray. On the return journey, the Fixture is skipped to optimize the route.

### 2. **Precision Stacking (Stack-Up)**

In this task, the robot demonstrates its precision by stacking six tokens and six blocks alternately. Success is determined by achieving a stable structure in the shortest possible time.

## Our Approach ðŸ§ 

Rather than focusing solely on speed, we prioritize a balanced approach that emphasizes precision, route optimization, and creative problem-solving. This allows us to meet the objectives while exploring real-world applications of robotic technology.

Thank you for joining us on this robotic adventure!
